Hello World in depth


```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello World!")
	foo()
	bar()
	for i := 0; i <= 20; i++ {
		if i%2 == 0 {
			fmt.Println(i)
		}
	}
	fmt.Println("bye!")
}

func foo() {
	fmt.Println("I'm in foo")
}

func bar() {
	fmt.Println("in bar and now to go back")
}

```
Its OK to name the program anything, but it is necessary that every program have the package main.
Every program needs to have func main as it is the entry point to that code and it is also the exit point of the application.

Remember to format the code using go fmt command.
Things to note:
- There is no semi colon on the end of each line
- There is no parenthesis on for, if etc
- The functions worked even though it is under the main function
- Functions are declared using func keyword
- The assignment operator is := and not =
